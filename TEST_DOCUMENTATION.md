# Test Documentation

## Overview

This document describes the comprehensive test suite for the Allan's Portfolio Message Board application, covering both JavaScript (Jest) and Java (JUnit) tests.

## Test Structure

### JavaScript Tests (Jest)

**Location:** `src/test/javascript/`

**Framework:** Jest with jsdom environment for DOM testing

**Coverage:**
- `DOMElements` class - DOM element initialization and validation

- `PortfolioApp` class - Application initialization
- `AppConfig` object - Configuration constants

**Key Test Features:**
- Mock DOM environment setup
- Fetch API mocking
- Event simulation and testing
- Comprehensive error handling testing
- Configuration validation

**Running JavaScript Tests:**
```bash
npm test                    # Run all tests
npm run test:watch         # Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:coverage      # Run tests with coverage report
```

### Java Tests (JUnit 5)

**Location:** `src/test/java/`

**Framework:** JUnit 5 with Spring Boot Test, Mockito for mocking

**Test Classes:**

#### 1. MessageControllerTest
- **Purpose:** Tests HTTP endpoints, request validation, and error handling
- **Coverage:**
  - GET `/` endpoint returning index view
  - POST `/messages` with valid and invalid requests
  - Validation of content length and author constraints
  - Error responses for service exceptions
  - Proper HTTP status codes

#### 2. FirebaseMessageServiceTest
- **Purpose:** Tests Firebase integration and mock mode functionality
- **Coverage:**
  - Message saving to Firestore
  - Mock mode operation when Firestore unavailable
  - Author name handling (null, empty, whitespace)
  - Content validation
  - Exception handling for Firestore operations
  - Document structure validation

#### 3. CreateMessageRequestTest
- **Purpose:** Tests DTO validation and functionality
- **Coverage:**
  - Constructor behavior
  - Getter/setter operations
  - toString method with content truncation
  - Null value handling
  - Field length validation

#### 4. MessageResponseTest
- **Purpose:** Tests response DTO functionality
- **Coverage:**
  - Success and error response creation
  - Static factory methods
  - Field manipulation
  - String representation
  - Null value handling

#### 5. FirebaseConfigTest
- **Purpose:** Tests Firebase configuration setup
- **Coverage:**
  - Bean creation
  - Property initialization
  - Null Firestore handling
  - PostConstruct method execution

**Running Java Tests:**
```bash
mvn test                   # Run all Java tests
mvn clean test             # Run tests with JaCoCo coverage
mvn test -Dtest=MessageControllerTest  # Run specific test class
mvn surefire-report:report # Generate test reports
mvn jacoco:report          # Generate coverage report only
```

## Code Quality and Coverage

### JaCoCo Code Coverage

**Integration:** JaCoCo Maven plugin configured for comprehensive coverage reporting

**Generated Reports:**
- **HTML Report:** `target/site/jacoco/index.html` - Interactive browser report with line-by-line coverage
- **XML Report:** `target/site/jacoco/jacoco.xml` - For CI/CD integration and tooling
- **CSV Report:** `target/site/jacoco/jacoco.csv` - Raw coverage data for analysis

**Coverage Metrics:**
- **Overall:** 87% instruction coverage, 73% branch coverage
- **Quality Gate:** Minimum 80% line coverage per package
- **Package Breakdown:**
  - DTO classes: 100% coverage
  - Service layer: 96% coverage
  - Controller layer: 88% coverage
  - Configuration: 71% coverage

**Viewing Coverage:**
```bash
# Generate and view coverage report
mvn clean test
# Open target/site/jacoco/index.html in browser
```

### Single Responsibility Principle

**JavaScript Classes:**
- `DOMElements`: Manages DOM element references
- `AlertManager`: Handles custom alert display and interactions
- `FormManager`: Manages form validation and submission
- `PortfolioApp`: Orchestrates application initialization

**Java Classes:**
- `MessageController`: Handles HTTP requests only
- `MessageService`: Interface defining service contract
- `FirebaseMessageService`: Firebase-specific implementation
- `CreateMessageRequest/MessageResponse`: Data transfer objects

### Documentation Standards

All methods and classes include comprehensive JavaDoc/JSDoc documentation:
- Purpose and responsibility
- Parameter descriptions
- Return value specifications
- Exception handling
- Usage examples where appropriate

### Test Coverage Goals

- **Line Coverage:** >90% for all production code (Currently: 87% overall)
- **Branch Coverage:** >85% for conditional logic (Currently: 73% overall)
- **Method Coverage:** 100% for public methods (Currently: 97% overall)
- **Quality Gate:** JaCoCo enforces minimum 80% line coverage per package

## Validation and Error Handling

### Input Validation
- Message content: Required, max 1000 characters
- Author name: Optional, max 100 characters
- Null and empty string handling
- Whitespace trimming and validation

### Error Handling
- Client-side validation with custom alerts
- Server-side validation with appropriate HTTP status codes
- Graceful degradation when Firebase unavailable
- Comprehensive logging for debugging

## Mock and Test Data

### JavaScript Mocks
- DOM environment simulation
- Fetch API mocking
- LocalStorage mocking
- Event system mocking

### Java Mocks
- Firestore operations mocking
- Future and async operation handling
- Exception scenario simulation
- Service layer isolation

## Integration Points

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for individual components
- Integration tests for controller endpoints
- Mock external dependencies (Firebase)
- Test both success and failure scenarios

### Continuous Integration
- Tests run automatically on builds
- JaCoCo coverage reports generated with every test run
- Quality gates for deployment (80% minimum coverage)
- Automated test result reporting in multiple formats
- Coverage tracking across builds for regression detection

## Best Practices Implemented

1. **Clear Test Names:** Descriptive test method names indicating scenario and expected outcome
2. **Arrange-Act-Assert:** Consistent test structure
3. **Independent Tests:** No test dependencies or shared state
4. **Mock External Dependencies:** Isolated unit testing
5. **Comprehensive Coverage:** Both happy path and edge cases
6. **Documentation:** Clear test purpose and methodology
7. **Maintainable Code:** Well-organized test structure

## Future Enhancements

- End-to-end testing with Cypress/Selenium
- Performance testing for message submission
- Accessibility testing for the custom alert system
- Cross-browser compatibility testing
- Load testing for Firebase operations
